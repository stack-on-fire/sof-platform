              Dimitri is an engineer that I had the pleasure to work with in a
              professional environment. His willingness to learn new things and
              to share his knowledge, makes him a great person to learn from.
              <br />
              <br />
              The fact, that he <b>builds his own SaaS</b> continuously and
              already <b>managed a profitable exit</b>, shows that he is an
              expert, not only on the theoretical side of things.

              Dimitri is the <b>one Person</b> I would ask about how to build a
              SaaS.
              <br />
              <br />
              He has done it before successfully, always keeps in touch with the
              latest tech, and is a phenomenal software architect and team lead.
              His content is top notch, and StackOnFire will make that available
              to everyone!

              Dimitri is a person who can <b>code</b> and <b>design</b> equally
              good! This means that if you are learning development from him you
              are actually learning to design clean interfaces with fantastic UX
              with the best industry practices!

              The main reason why I started coding was that{" "}
              <b>I wanted to create a SaaS</b> . But my problem was that I had
              no idea where to start my learning journey.
              <br />
              <br />
              Luckily Stack on Fire solves these problems for me. Now I finally
              know where to look for the right tools I need in order to build a
              SaaS.
