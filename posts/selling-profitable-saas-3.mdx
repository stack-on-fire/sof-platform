## TL;DR

I am a software developer with years of experience in both frontend and backend operating on JavaScript/Typescript. I am active on Twitter and at point I decided to built a tool for myself. For 4 months I’ve been building it as a side project and after reaching **$250 MRR** I decided to sell it. The whole deal was **6-figure** and I enjoyed the process much :D

<br />

This is the third part of the series of blogposts where I outline my learnings and share them with you you can launch/earn/sell your side(or even next big thing) project! This one is about why I decided to sell the app which was growing successfully and what steps I took to close the deal.

### Why did you sell Tweetastic?

I got this question in my twitter DMs after the announcement a few times. I have to say that it was not easy to acknowledge the fact that something I spent my hobby time on did not take off in a way I expected.

<br />

Although I achieved stunning $250 MRR (stunning, because it was my first commercial side project) at point I understood that there is much competition out there with new twitter tools popping up almost every second week and it creates a problem for me. Problem which lies within the spectrum of time and space :D To fight competition in a niche where developers are solo making their products(turbulent, features are added daily, hard to keep up with new developments) you have to answer with the same amount of features + spend a lot of time marketing your product. I did not have time for that. Moreover my twitter audience was not a target audience of a twitter scheduling tool - those would have been happy users, but they were not willing to pay for it.

### So selling the app you say? How one does it?

To sell an application which is written in a modern tech stack, has paying users and does not have unreasonably high churn rate you don’t need to do much. I posted couple of tweets on twitter and listed the app on Microaquire. Soon enough my DMs were full of interested buyers.

<br />

You have to have a clear value of the app that you would not sell below before going into negotiations or things might get frustrating. First offers that I started to get were in a range of 500$. I understood that I would not sell below $15,000 which was reasonable 5x multiple of yearly MRR - those offers got directly into the bin. Even though I was ridiculed by most of them I took time to politely answer that they don’t fall into my expectations.

<br />

While these small offers are not acceptable it’s evident that buyers will not require solid KPIs numbers from your side to close the deal. Here we are coming to better offers which have something more to them.

> For adequate offers you will need to defend your numbers and supply all the information, which is not private, to the buyer

MRR, churn rate, daily active customers, landing page views, conversion rate and even more to that. I was lucky that I had the information at hands - nevertheless I had to take it from different sources but eventually I had a solid lineup of numbers which spoke for themselves. My first mistake was going on sale without having them prepared straight ahead. As with everything, we learn from mistakes and do better next time :D In your case you can use my experience and when building a startup setup your metrics in a correct way straight ahead.

<br />

This said I can firmly state that the best offers were coming from Microaquire. The platform is solid in guiding you in filing the information of the sold product. Even if you don’t plan to sell, do it for self development, I promise you’ll learn something new.

<br />

When listed there my recommendation would be to let the initial offering lay there for a while. You’ll get more offers and this will create an opportunity to talk with multiple potential buyers. As you will engage in those discussions the asymmetry of information will become less and less and you will be even better prepared for the further negotiations.

<br />

After you talk with a potential buyer and you have a click it’s crucial to set everything on paper, so the deal starts to acquire legal form. Both parties have to be protected from unexpected circumstances and the better the protection, the better the perceived safety. In my case I immediately saw that person who wanted to buy Tweetastic was trustworthy. You might want to look at things the person asks about the product, ask about why they want to acquire the product and pay a closer attention at their track record on the internet.
