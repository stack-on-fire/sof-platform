## TL;DR

I am a software developer with years of experience in both frontend and backend operating fully on JavaScript/Typescript. I am very active on Twitter and at some point I decided to built a tool for myself. For 4 months I’ve been building it as a side project and after reaching **$250 MRR** I decided to sell it.

<br />

The whole deal was **6-figure** and I enjoyed the process very much :D This is the first part of the series of blogposts where I outline my learnings and share them with you so you can also launch/earn/sell your side(or maybe even next big thing) project! This one is about the first step - coming up with the idea and iterating fast :D

## Coming up with the idea. Three main learnings.

I must admit that when I was thinking about going part-time indie hacker I had so many questions and struggled much at the start. The write up to follow is aimed at making your life at least a little bit easier!

### Don’t search for something super unique - execution shall be your main strength.

There are tons of ideas out there. It’s important to understand that usually two things matter the most:

1. Nothing is unique anymore - **best implementation wins**
2. Working on something which is **fun** specifically **to you** at this given point in time is a superpower

When choosing an idea for your SaaS project you can be driven by one of the several approaches - building something which solves your own problem, building something that solves the problem of a group of people or identifying the problem to solve which is not yet identified by anybody.

<br />

The ideal lies within the intersection of those, thus it being an ideal it’s really hard to reach. Usually the low hanging fruit is combination of 1&2 of the above - you solve your own problem and in the meantime provide a solution for a wider audience that hopefully will be willing to pay for that.

<br />

Being a customer of your own product is a blessing for a software developer as you will usually know the most of the pain points and will be able to tackle them right away.

### Iterate fast. No idea is rigid - embrace it’s fluidity.

When I started building Tweetastic it didn’t have a name nor shape. It started as a telegram bot to update me on my growth, evolved into CLI(command line interface) to look for the most popular tweets of a given person and finally took a shape of a web application that combined the functionalities of bot, CLI and introduced scheduling.

<br />

Did I know that I was building all-in-one twitter tool when I started? Nope. Was it clear who my target customer was? Not really. Do you need to know the answer for such questions before you start building? It would really help, but I’d argue about it being really a necessity.

<br />

Fun part of building commercial indie products is that you can start simple and develop your ideas based on customer feedback and the actual usage of your product.

And here we come to the most interesting part of this particular blog post :D

### Make it commercial as fast as possible.

To validate your idea - your only way is to ask people to vote with their wallets. No questions on twitter like ‘Would you pay for this?’, no polls or discussions with fellow indie hackers would actually help you identifying the validity better than good old pricing section on the landing page that leads users to unlocking the functionalities of your app.

<br />

Implementing single payments or recurring payments is not easy though. For some it might be a knowledge limitation, for others like me geographical one(Stripe is not available for Ukrainian citizens), others might face technical limitations integrating payments into your existing apps. Nevertheless this should be **the first priority** of yours as soon as you have your dirty MVP launched. Hooking up payments is not a rocket science and it’s usually learn/implement once - use in all projects kinda of skill. To sum it up once again let’s boil this post down to three main learnings:

1. If you feel like your idea would help you(including helping you learn something new) & at least couple of other people - it’s good enough to start working on it.
2. Don’t get married with your idea, if you want to totally change vector of it - that’s great, the more you try the more chances you stumble on something cool. That said you will also learn a ton, being a first and only one developer on a project practically **equals heavy learning**
3. Charge money from **day 1**, if not possible aim at the soonest.

Looking forward to seeing you at second post of the series where I will talk about choosing the tech stack for your project and main fuckups I’ve had while building Tweetastic app.
